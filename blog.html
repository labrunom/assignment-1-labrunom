        <h2>Post 1</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>As this was my first web development project it was very ne wand interesting.</li>
            <li>I had a bit of trouble figuring out how to get the image to work.</li>
            <li>It was easier to publish than I thought it would be.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Post 2</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>I had quite a bit of trouble with getting everything to stay spaced out properly. I solved this with google and trial and error. I also had trouble with the colors because I'm color blind(I did not solve this).</li>
            <li>I learned how to properly format a website so it doesn't look terrible.</li>
            <li>Google, the Ed discussions, and the lecture videos were all great resources.</li>
            <li>I had to google how to space out the various items and how to transform the post button.</li>
        </ul>
